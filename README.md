This will be my personal [AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/) static website.
Static website generation toolchain used in this project has been implemented by myself.

## Techonlogies used:
- [**Gulp**](http://gulpjs.com/) with it's plugins as a CLI
- [**es6 template strings**](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/01/ES6-Template-Strings) and [**tag functions**](http://www.2ality.com/2016/05/template-literal-whitespace.html) as a template system
- [**Stylus**](http://stylus-lang.com/) as a CSS-preprocessor
- [**marked**](https://github.com/chjj/marked) markdown processor

Current static website generation toolchain only works on **node** v6.5.0 or higher (because it uses es6 features without transpiler).

Work on this site is still in progress and this readme will be updated accordingly.
